What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-- Outcomes are most likely to be successful when the launch date is in the 3rd quarter of the year.
-- The peak launch month is in May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-- The highest percentage of succesful outcomes are when the goal amount is less than $5000
-- Another successful peak appears to be between $35,000 - $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-- There is not a lot of information about the demographics of the backers.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
--  We could see if there is a correlation between the "Staff Pick" and the number of successful campaigns.
--  We could also determine if there is a correlation between "Spotlight" and successful campaigns.
